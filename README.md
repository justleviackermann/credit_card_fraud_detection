## LEARNING EXPERIENCE


![Ganeshkumar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ganeshkumar-20c997)

It was a good time learning how we can select the best model among the models available by visualizing the dataset in different ways.

I also learned how to deal with imbalanced datasets and how to use system resources effectively to select a single best model for our system.

It was a good time working and learning with these peoples.

Starting from understanding the problem with imbalanced data we have explored different sampling techniques like Nearmiss and SMOTE.

From Comparing different ML models to evaluating them by using metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) inorder to judge the fraud detection properly, I got know many useful things as a beginner.

This project gave me a oppurtunity to train a ML model with imbalanced data , learning the techniques to train ML model with imbalanced data using SMOTE technique and  deep dive into various fundamentals like negative correlation , t-SNE algorithm and random undersampling technique,etc.

Had a great time learning with you guys!
