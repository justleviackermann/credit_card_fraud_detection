This project provided valuable insights into selecting the best-performing models through effective data visualization.

We developed a strong understanding of handling imbalanced datasets and optimizing resource usage.

The project was collaboratively carried out by

<span style="color:teal; font-weight:bold;">

It was a good time learning how we can select the best model among the models available by visualizing the dataset in different ways.

I also learnt how to deal with the imbalanced dataset and how to use our resource effectively to select a single best model for our system.

It was a good time working and learning  with these people(
    <span style="color:#E8590C; font-weight:bold;">Tejaswini</span> and <span style="color:#1C7ED6; font-weight:bold;">Rohit</span>) .
