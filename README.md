## LEARNING EXPERIENCE


![Ganeshkumar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ganeshkumar-20c997)

It was a good time learning how we can select the best model among the models available by visualizing the dataset in different ways.

I also learned how to deal with imbalanced datasets and how to use system resources effectively to select a single best model for our system.

It was a good time working and learning with these peoples.
